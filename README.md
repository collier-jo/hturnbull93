# Harry Turnbull

I'm a freelance web developer, currently training at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) (London's leading programming bootcamp) to become a junior developer.

I have developed skills in Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, HTML and CSS.

I want to create programs that are not only useful for users, but also engaging and interesting to keep them coming back for more.

### Time Management

During my time as a freelance web designer I have often worked on several projects simultaneously. I manage my time effectively, focussing on tasks of high importance and urgency first.

### Communication

Often I have needed to keep multiple stakeholders informed about the progress of projects. I assess stakeholder requirements quickly to manage expectations and deliver information effectively.

### Team focussed

I have often worked as a part of a team for various professional and personal projects. I make sure each member's contributions are heard and that all members take part in making decisions.
