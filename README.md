# Harry Turnbull

After graduating university with a Masters in Life Sciences, I got to grips with programming at my first job, where I built simple web scrapers in Microsoft VBA to automate tasks. Many jobs I've had since then have touched on programming, which has been the thing I found most interesting about them.

I have been a self-trained freelance web developer for the past three years, but I wanted to get on to the next level. This passion led me to train at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) (London's leading programming bootcamp) in order to become a professional software developer.

I want to create software that is not only useful for users, but also engaging and interesting to keep them coming back for more.

### Team-Focused

During my final project at Makers, we took on React. While I already had some experience with React, a lot of the team hadn't.

In order to accelerate our project and to progress as a group, I spent time making sure everyone had the necessary skills in React and Jest (the testing framework) to contribute as effectively as possible.

### Project Organisation

During my time as a freelance web designer I often worked on several projects simultaneously. I manage my time effectively, focusing on tasks of high importance and urgency first.

At Makers we often worked in groups on larger scale projects. Using XP/Agile methodologies and task tracking methodologies such as Kanban, I ensured our workflow was clear and efficiently managed.

### Communication

Often I have needed to keep multiple stakeholders informed about progress, be they the project manager, a freelance client, or a teammate.

Understanding each of their needs and clarifying the meaning of their questions allows me to give them the information they care about in a way they understand.

### Technical Knowledge

I have worked with a variety of languages, technologies and softwares:
