</h2>

I am a Full Stack developer, looking for opportunities to continue to learn, challenge myself and work with great people to build useful apps that consumers enjoy using.

I'm passionate about the intersection of technology and creativity. I am self-taught and have been working as a Web Designer for the past three years, which has allowed me to gain skills in Front-End design and implementation, as well as UI/UX design.

I have recently completed training at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) (London's leading programming bootcamp), to learn best practices, tools and methodologies.

## Skills

### Leadership

During my final project at Makers, we took on React. As the most experienced React developer, I took it upon myself to help my team fill any knowledge gaps. I did this by discussing examples I had created with them to test their knowledge of the technology. This accelerated our development greatly.

I later led the project team through a sprint with the aim to refactor the entire codebase, going from 31 tests with 66% code coverage to 57 tests with 97% coverage, a significant improvement.

### Project Management

At Makers we often worked in groups on larger scale projects using XP/Agile methodologies and task tracking methods such as Kanban.

During my time as Project Manager at Freedom Tech, I created automated workflows for several of my responsibilities, allowing me to keep track of customer requirements during peak business seasons.

### Communication

<!-- Often I have needed to keep multiple stakeholders informed about progress, be they the project manager, a freelance client, or a teammate. Understanding each of their needs and clarifying the meaning of their questions allows me to give them the information they care about in a way they understand. -->

When communicating with non-technical stakeholders, I translate technical details to and from less technical terms easily. Additionally, I have successfully used my ability to communicate, and my experience of good UX/UI design, to persuade clients away from features that would annoy users.

### Reflection

I believe the best way to know if you truly understand something is to communicate it clearly to someone else. With that in mind I maintain a [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@hturnbull93) of things I learn and want to share my understanding of.

### Technical Knowledge

I have worked with a variety of languages, technologies and softwares.

- **Cycling** - I enjoy cycling, especially e-bikes.

- **Running** - I run to keep fit, and sometimes I enjoy it.
