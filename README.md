# Harry Turnbull

I'm a freelance web developer, currently training at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), London's leading programming bootcamp. 

I have developed skills in Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, HTML and CSS. 

I'm interested in creating programs that are useful, but also engaging and interesting.
