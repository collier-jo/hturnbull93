# Harry Turnbull

I want to be part of a team of passionate, smart people, working to build useful apps that consumers enjoy using.

I have been a self-trained freelance web developer for the past three years. I'm passionate about the intersection of technology and creativity. This led me to train at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) (London's leading programming bootcamp), to learn best practices, tools and methodologies, and become a professional Front End Developer.

I'm looking for opportunities where I can continue to learn, challenge myself and work with great people to build amazing things.

<!-- After graduating university with a Masters in Life Sciences I got to grips with programming at my first job where I built simple web scrapers in Microsoft VBA to automate tasks. Many jobs I've had since then have touched on programming, which has been the thing I found most interesting about them. -->

## Skills

### Team-Focused

During my final project at Makers, we took on React. While I already had some experience with React, a lot of the team hadn't.

In order to accelerate our project and to progress as a group, I spent time making sure everyone had the necessary skills in React and Jest (the testing framework) to contribute as effectively as possible.

### Project Organisation

During my time as a freelance web designer I often worked on several projects simultaneously. I manage my time effectively, focusing on tasks of high importance and urgency first.

At Makers we often worked in groups on larger scale projects. Using XP/Agile methodologies and task tracking methodologies such as Kanban, I ensured our workflow was clear and efficiently managed.

### Communication

Often I have needed to keep multiple stakeholders informed about progress, be they the project manager, a freelance client, or a teammate. Understanding each of their needs and clarifying the meaning of their questions allows me to give them the information they care about in a way they understand.

I believe the best way to know if you truly understand something is to communicate it clearly to someone else. With that in mind I maintain a [Medium blog] of things I learn and want to share my understanding of.

### Technical Knowledge
